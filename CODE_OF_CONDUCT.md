# [Not A Community (NAC) Code of Conduct](https://github.com/ljedrz/NAC)

This is not a community - it's a code repository, and its only goal is to provide useful, quality code.

1. Contributors are discouraged from employing or referring to any sort of personal identity; names, avatars, bios, etc. are - for the purposes of this repository - of no relevance whatsoever.
2. All contributor activity that furthers the goal of the repository is welcome.
3. Any contributor activity that is unrelated to or goes against the goal of the repository is unwelcome.
4. Any contributor activity outside of the repository is of no consequence.
